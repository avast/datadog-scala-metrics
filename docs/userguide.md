## Quick start

### Installation
To start monitoring your code, first you need to add this library as a dependency to your project. This project is composed of multiple packages to make it easy for you to pick and choose what you require. 

You need to add `datadog-metrics-api` which contains classes defining our API. You also need to add it's implementation. Currently we only support metric delivery using StatsD in package `datadog-metrics-statsd` which already contains `api`. We are going to assume you are using `sbt`:

```scala
libraryDependencies += "com.avast.cloud" %% "datadog-metrics-api" % "0.1.2"
```

### Creating metric factory
To start creating your metrics, first you need to create a `MetricFactory[F[_]]`. Currently the only implementation is in `statsd` package. MetricFactory is purely functional so it requires you to provide type constructor which implements `cats.effect.Sync`. For the simplicity, we will use `cats.effect.IO` in these examples.

To create an instance, we need to provide it with configuration which contains a few basic fields, like address of the StatsD server, prefix etc. For more information see scaladoc of the config class.

The instance is wrapped in `Resource` because of the underlying `StatsD` client.

```scala mdoc
import java.net.InetSocketAddress
import cats.effect._
import com.avast.cloud.metrics.datadog.api._
import com.avast.cloud.metrics.datadog.api.metric._
import com.avast.cloud.metrics.datadog._

val statsDServer = InetSocketAddress.createUnresolved("localhost", 8125)
val config = StatsDMetricFactoryConfig("my-app-name", statsDServer)

val factoryResource: Resource[IO, MetricFactory[IO]] = StatsDMetricFactory.make(config)
```

### Creating metrics
Once you have a metrics factory, creating metrics is straight forward.

```scala mdoc
factoryResource.use { factory =>
    val count: Count[IO] = factory.count("hits")
    count.inc() // increase count by one

    val histogram: Histogram[IO, Long] = factory.histogram.long("my-histogram")
    histogram.record(1337, Tag.of("username", "xyz")) // record a value to histogram with Tag
}
```

### Timers
Timers are great. And with our API, they are even better. Because we are living in functional code, we expect you to provide us with `F[_]: Sync` and we will time how long execution takes, and tag it with whether it succeded and if it failed, which class of exception was thrown.

```scala mdoc

factoryResource.use { factory =>
    val timer = factory.timer("request-latency")

    timer.time(IO.pure(println("success"))) // tagged as success
    timer.time(IO.raiseError(new Exception("error"))) //tagged as failure
}
```

## Extensions
Extensions are packages that monitor some functionality for you - without you having to do anything.

### Jvm monitoring
JVM monitoring package (`datadog-scala-jvm`) collects bunch of JVM metrics that we found useful over last 5 or so years running JVM apps in Avast. Those metrics can be found in [JvmReporter][jvm-reporter-class] and are hopefully self explenatory. 

Usage can not be simpler (unless you want to configure things like collection-frequency etc.). Simply add following to your initialization code. Resource is returned, because `Scheduler` has to be created which does the actual metric collection.

```scala mdoc
import com.avast.cloud.metrics.datadog.extension.jvm._

val jvmMonitoring: Resource[IO, Unit] = factoryResource.flatMap(factory => JvmMonitoring.default[IO](factory))
jvmMonitoring.use { _ => 
    // your application is in here
    IO.pure(())
}
```
