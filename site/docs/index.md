Toolkit for monitoring applications written in functional Scala using Datadog.

Goal of this project is to make great monitoring as easy as possible.

In addition to basic monitoring utilities, we also provide a bunch of plug-and-play modules that do monitoring for you.
Currently, those are:

- JVM monitoring
- Http4s monitoring

For the documentation, please read our [user guide](userguide.html).
